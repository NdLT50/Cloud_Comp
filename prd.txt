Business Requirements:
1. The service must create a user with fields: email and password.
2. Email must be validated to contain "@".
3. Password must be at least 8 characters long.
4. Passwords must NOT be stored in plain text (hashing required).
5. The service must raise a ValueError if validation fails.
